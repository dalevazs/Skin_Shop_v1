This Project was worked from the inside out the idea came from practicing the concept of inheritance and modules.
It's purpose is to allow users to "purchase", save and customize their own skins.
If you would like to learn more about the shop itself and the UI please refer Skin_Shop.pdf

Now the skin_module which is used on skin_customization is another story.

It's purpose is to further simplify my code, structuring it into different pieces.

Using Python classes and inheritance. The system defines different types of skins "Legendary, Seasonal, and Custom" while class "Skin" remains the parent class and provides methods for calculating prices and displaying information.
